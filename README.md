# noswap-sort

noswap is a sorting algorithm that takes advantage of javascript's array functionality. It works completely
without swapping or comparing numbers, which makes it very fast and lightweight.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install noswap

```bash
npm i noswap-sort
```

## Usage

```python
nsort = require('noswap-sort');

var list = [5, 2, 1000, 20 1];

list = nsort(list);

//list = [1, 2, 5, 20, 1000]
```
